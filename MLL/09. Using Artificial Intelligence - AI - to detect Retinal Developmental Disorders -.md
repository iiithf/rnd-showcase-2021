# Using Artificial Intelligence - AI - to detect Retinal Developmental Disorders

![](https://i.imgur.com/uPOGmxg.png)

Our work involves the development of medical image classification and gaze tracking model for detection of saccadic movements of the eye. Since there were no AI systems available for paediatric OCT or childhood nystagmus, we aimed to develop a quick, automated AI system to accurately differentiate normal foveal structure and grades of Foveal hypoplasia(FH) in paediatric retinal OCT images for both Leica Envisu & Copernicus devices.
