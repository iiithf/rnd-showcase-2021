# Machine Learning Lab

Machine Learning is a science that enables machines (especially computers) to learn from environments and make own decisions. At Machine Learning Laboratory, we carry out research and develop different theoretical foundations for machine learning such as: How machines should help in planning activities by learning from environments. How machines should learn in the presence of noisy environment. How learning gets affected if different machine learning algorithms are trying compete instead of cooperating. Role of deep learning in planning, reinforcement learning and game theory.
