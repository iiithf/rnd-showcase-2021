![](04.%20Effect%20of%20emotion%20and%20personality%20types%20in%20human%20agent%20automated%20negotiations.png)

In this work, we use a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) based modeling of the opponent personality types when there is an involvement of human emotional factor in an Automated Negotiation. We use the four standard negotiation personality types which are Individualist, Cooperator, Competitor, and Altruist. We focus on showcasing how a change in the emotion of the computational agent brings the differences in the personality types individually.
