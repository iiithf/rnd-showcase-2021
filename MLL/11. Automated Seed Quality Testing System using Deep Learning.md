![](11.%20Automated%20Seed%20Quality%20Testing%20System%20using%20Deep%20Learning.png)

The purpose of this poster is to present an image processing-based solution to classify the different varieties of corn seeds and its quality analysis using Deep Learning. We used the Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate the fake images to balanced the data set and increase the diversity for the class instances.
