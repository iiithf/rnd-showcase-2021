# An Active Learning based annotation tool for classifying Retinal Fundus Images based on Hypopigmentation grades

We developed an offline mobile web app (local setup available) that is designed primarily to annotate Fundus Images based on Hypopigmentation levels. To minimize the cost of annotation (i.e number of images to be manually annotated), we use Active Learning for predicting the labels of the next set of images by an ML model which learns from the images manually annotated by a domain expert.
