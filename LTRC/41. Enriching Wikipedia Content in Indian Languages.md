# Enriching Wikipedia Content in Indian Languages

![](https://i.imgur.com/mx5Nccm.png)

Wikipedia is the most widely used resource of the Encyclopaedic Knowledge, Education, and Literacy platform on the Web. In India, the majority (approx. 90%) of the population is proficient only in their native language, refraining them from using English Wikipedia directly. However, creating content in Wikipedia is a non-trivial task and requires the skills of scientific writing. To facilitate this, we are building an automated system named IndicWikiBot to generate an initial version of the full Wikipedia article that humans can later edit or improve. Besides, we are also developing strategies to build a large community of human experts (community building) and advancing technology to enhance the productivity of the Wikipedia editors (content development). IndicWikiBot processes both structured (Knowledge Bases, Databases, etc.) and unstructured information (running texts, webpages, etc.) to generate Wikipedia articles in Indian languages. It involves using cutting-edge AI/ML/NLP and text generation techniques.
