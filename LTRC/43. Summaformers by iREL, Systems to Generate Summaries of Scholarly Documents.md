Scholarly documents tailored towards individuals having knowledge of a particular domain are lengthy & complicated. Assimilating crucial information from them is both laborious & time-consuming. Our Lay Summarizer generates extremely-short paper summaries capturing the essence of the research work in layman terms, restricting overly specific technical jargon. We also present our Long Summarizer that produces lengthier and comprehensive document summaries. An extended & insightful summary provides a deep understanding of a paper's various concepts to readers without thoroughly analyzing the entire manuscript.
