The problem of content verification and misinformation has been an age old problem. Since the rise in popularity of social networks, news is no longer monopolized by newspapers, TV, radio. The rate at which content is generated has grown exponentially. This leads to the proliferation of misleading information in everyday access media outlets such as social media feeds, news blogs, and online newspapers. This has made it challenging to identify trustworthy news sources. Manual solutions can no longer keep up with the rate at which content is being churned out and hence we look at automated approaches for the problem.
