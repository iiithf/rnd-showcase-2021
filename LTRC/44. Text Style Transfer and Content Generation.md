# Text Style Transfer and Content Generation

![](44.%20Text%20Style%20Transfer%20and%20Content%20Generation.png)

Text Style Transfer aims to change the text's stylistic properties while retaining its meaning. It aims to control specific attributes in the generated text, such as politeness, emotion, humor, and many others. Currently, the team is working on three different projects. The first project is hate to non-hate style transfer in text. Given a text identified as hateful, convert it to non-hateful text while preserving its meaning. The second project deals with informal to formal text style transfer in a specific setting, like rental agreements. We focus on creating a template-driven formal document based on features derived from some informal data. Lastly, we work on multimodal summarization, where the goal is to produce news summaries given relevant text and images.
