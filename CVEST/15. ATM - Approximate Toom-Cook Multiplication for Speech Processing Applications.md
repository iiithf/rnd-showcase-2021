# ATM - Approximate Toom-Cook Multiplication for Speech Processing Applications

Approximate Computing has paved way for elaborate savings in design area and latency of modern system architectures processing images or signals, by a deliberate yet tolerable loss of functional accuracy. This project presents a design of an approximate multiplier based on the efficient Toom-Cook algorithm, that has a lower complexity.
