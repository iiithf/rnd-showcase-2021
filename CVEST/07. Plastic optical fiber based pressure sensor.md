Designing of Plastic optical fiber (POF) based pressure sensing carpet for Gait analysis. An implantation of tomographic imaging based on POF sensors which is way to develop imagers for various parameter such as pressure. Sensor head size 27cm*18cm is capable of performing the imaging task as well as storing the numerical data for processing.
