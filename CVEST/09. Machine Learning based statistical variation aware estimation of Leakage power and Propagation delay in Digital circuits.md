# Machine Learning based statistical variation aware estimation of Leakage power and Propagation delay in Digital circuits

![](https://i.imgur.com/prgjtkP.png)

Our research introduces accurate machine learning models for statistical and operating variation aware estimation based on Multivariate Polynomial Regression, Gradient Boosting, Support vector machines and Artificial Neural Network, which exhibits innately faster computation and attains error less than 1% for the targeted HP/LP CMOS technology nodes ranging from 45nm to 16nm in CMOS and FinFET technology nodes from 22nm to 7nm although model is black box for any technology.
