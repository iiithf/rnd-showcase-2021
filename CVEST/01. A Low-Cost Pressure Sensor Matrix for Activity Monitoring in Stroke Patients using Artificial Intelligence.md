# A Low-Cost Pressure Sensor Matrix for Activity Monitoring in Stroke Patients using Artificial Intelligence

![](https://i.imgur.com/54YiN3K.png)

A flexible pressure sensor matrix is designed using paper as a structural material. It is a 4 x 4 pressure sensor matrix in which a piezoresistive material named velostat is sandwiched between two papers, on which copper tapes are attached. The working principle is based on the piezoresistive effect of the polymer composite, velostat. This sensor can be used for various applications such as, recognizing activity and assessing the recovery of the stroke patients by performing various exercises on the pressure sensor mat and can also be used in smart chairs for posture recognition.
