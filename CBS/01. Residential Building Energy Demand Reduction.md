Residential building energy demand reduction in India (RESIDE), is a Indo- UK joint research project to understand the electricity consumption pattern in 2000 homes in several cities across five climatic zones in India. The purpose of this study is to better understand how electricity is used in Indian homes, so as to identify ways of managing and reducing its use. The data will also help in developing representative models of residential buildings for India and a residential energy code.
