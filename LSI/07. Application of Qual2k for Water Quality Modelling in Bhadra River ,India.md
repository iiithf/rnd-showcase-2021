![](https://i.imgur.com/K8xaiBT.png)

The main Objective of the present study is to predict water quality parameters-DO (Dissolved Oxygen) and BOD5 (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) along the reach of Bhadra River using Qual2k model and develop speculative scenarios to maintain DO concentration of the Bhadra River within the permissible limits.
