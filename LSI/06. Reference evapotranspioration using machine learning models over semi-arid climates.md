# Reference evapotranspioration using machine learning models over semi-arid climates

![](06.%20Reference%20evapotranspioration%20using%20machine%20learning%20models%20over%20semi-arid%20climates.png)

This study aims to develop different Machine Learning models, for modelling evapotranspiration at Hyderabad and waipara stations.To assess the performance and stability of these models with different input combinations over the two stations and find an appropriate approach to boost the modelling performance under the limited input factors condition.
