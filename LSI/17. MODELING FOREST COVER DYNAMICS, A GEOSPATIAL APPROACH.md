![](https://i.imgur.com/Xzf6kM0.jpg)

Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) are the basic measures to assess the health of a forested landscape. The comprehensive understanding of a forested landscape necessitates to derive the relationship among biophysical and socio-economic process acting, which also further aids in visualising likely changes through modeling. Spatio temporal LULC analysis through remote sensing data highlights the unplanned developmental activities and their influence on the ecological integrity. The Modeling of landscape dynamics in central Western Ghats region has been carried out evaluate the likely changes in this ecologically significant area.
