# Development of an Indoor Space Semantic model and its implementation as an IndoorGml extension

![](https://i.imgur.com/VSiEjWV.png)

A space classification model is proposed leading to an ontology for indoor spaces that accounts for both the semantic and geometric characteristics of the spaces. Further, a Space semantic model is defined, based on this ontology, which can then be used appropriately in multiple applications through the proposed extension to the IndoorGML data standard.
