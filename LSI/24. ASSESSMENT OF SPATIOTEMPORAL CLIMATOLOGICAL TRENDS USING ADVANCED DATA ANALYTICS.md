# ASSESSMENT OF SPATIOTEMPORAL CLIMATOLOGICAL TRENDS USING ADVANCED DATA ANALYTICS

![](24.%20ASSESSMENT%20OF%20SPATIOTEMPORAL%20CLIMATOLOGICAL%20TRENDS%20USING%20ADVANCED%20DATA%20ANALYTICS.png)

Many satellite and ground based observations are being collected at regional as well as global scales to study various climate variables in order to assess the climate change and its associated impact. Systematic analysis of long term data becomes crucial in such studies. This aims to build a data analytics workflow for generating long-term spatio-temporal trends in climate parameters.
