# Spatiotemporal changes in timberline of Sikkim Himalaya - Challenges and recommendations for generating timberline geo-database -

![](https://i.imgur.com/ETadkIp.png)

The present study improvises the on-going effort of vegetation mapping by defining rules to aid image interpretation. Thus, it helps eliminate auto-extraction errors and develop an approach for regional-scale mapping of Himalayan timberline using field-based inputs. The results of timberline mapping from different satellite imageries were compared at regional and watershed scale. This study is the first attempt to highlight timberline as a geographical entity, map scale on mapping, and its spatial attributes.
