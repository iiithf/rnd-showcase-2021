# Assessment of varying land use change in different states using Geo-spatial techniques - A case study for Krishna river basin, India

![](https://i.imgur.com/J3BPqqt.png)

In this work, spatio-temporal land use land cover agri change analysis is done using Geo-spatial techniques namely remote sensing and GIS on krishna river basin India for years 2005-2015 which concludes the varying change in this region. This work has been the basis of identifying the drivers which causes this change and by quantifying it which will help in prediction (spatially explicit) modeling
