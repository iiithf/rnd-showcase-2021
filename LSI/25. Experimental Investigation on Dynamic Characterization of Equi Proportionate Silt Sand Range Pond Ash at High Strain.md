# Experimental Investigation on Dynamic Characterization of Equi Proportionate Silt Sand Range Pond Ash at High Strain

![](https://i.imgur.com/iwCct97.png)

It was attempted to investigate the cyclic resistance of equi-proportionate silt sand range pond ash (with 50% fnes) at relatively high shear strains using the strain-controlled cyclic triaxial test. The cyclic triaxial tests have been performed considering the efect of relative compaction (97 99%), cyclic shear strain (0.6 1.35%), frequency of loading (0.3 1 Hz) and efective confning pressure (50 100 kPa) on cyclic resistance of pond ash. Dynamic characteristics such as dynamic shear modulus and damping ratio of equi-proportionate silt sand range pond ash was evaluated for all the parameters considered at high shear strain.
