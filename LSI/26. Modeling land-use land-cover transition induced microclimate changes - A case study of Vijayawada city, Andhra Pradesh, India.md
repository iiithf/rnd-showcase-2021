The research presented here utilizes remote sensing and GIS techniques to study the spatial expansion of the Vijayawada city, Andhra Pradesh from 1990 - 2018 and its consequences on the microclimate land surface temperature fluctuations. A cellular automata based hybrid algorithm in combination with genetic algorithm was developed to model the future scenario of the city in 2020 and 2030. With the knowledge of the temperature fluctuations observed during summer and winter seasons over the study area for the past 28 years and based on the projected scenario of the city for 2020 and 2030, a novel algorithm based on kernel ridge regression was developed to predict the land surface temperature.
