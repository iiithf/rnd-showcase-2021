# Mapping Forest Burnt Severity across Spatial Scales and determining impact of fire severity on Vegetation Regrowth Using Burnt Severity Metrics and Deep Learning Techniques -

![](https://i.imgur.com/siXlHCb.png)

This study was a Remote Sensing and Deep Learning approach to map fire severity and to assess its effects on the vegetation growth of Indian Forests using Landsat(30 m) time-series data and its available products. Two popular fire severity indices, differenced Normalized Burn ratio(dNBR) and Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio(RdNBR) were used to detect Burn severity. Time series analysis of dNBR and RdNBR were conducted in this study to understand the vegetation dynamics and change in vegetation phenology cycle after the fires.
