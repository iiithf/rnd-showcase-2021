# Validation of Kriging to Understand Volcanic Eruption Event Temperature Profiles to Improve Gradients in NWP Models

The aim of the study is to validate if geostatistics robustly model the variations in volcanic ash dispersed in the atmosphere with lesser false positives across different spatial scales. This involves identification of suitable interpolation method to arrive at Go/No-Go categorization of regions that can be used in safety critical scenarios.
