MAARG system is an innovative collaborative system for road condition monitoring leveraging the existing technologies by information fusion approach. Derived from geo-citizenship, we envision an ecosystem operating through a mobile application on smart-phones of geo-citizens for large data collection and executing centralized processing.This acts as an input to the query engine and visualizer where the users can visualize different spatio-temporal queries.
