# An Analysis of deriving hydrological characteristics with multi source DEM

![](01.%20An%20Analysis%20of%20deriving%20hydrological%20characteristics%20with%20multi%20source%20DEM.png)

This will present the study on delineating the hydrological characteristics from flat terrain as well as from moderately undulating terrain using Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of various resolutions namely, 5m LiDAR DEM, 10m CARTODEM and 30m (SRTM DEM).The results of this study indicates that high resolution DEMs can better represent the stream network , leading to a better modelling outcome.
