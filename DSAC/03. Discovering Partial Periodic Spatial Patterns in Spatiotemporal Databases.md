# Discovering Partial Periodic Spatial Patterns in Spatiotemporal Databases

![](https://i.imgur.com/U6o9l98.png)

A partial periodic pattern represents a set of items that repeats itself at regular intervals in the data. It is thus useful in characterizing the cyclic behavior.The current partial periodic pattern models are not ideal for some applications because they disregard the crucial information about the spatial (or geometric) characteristics of an item.With this motivation, this paper proposes a more flexible model of partial periodic spatial pattern that exists in a spatiotemporal database.
