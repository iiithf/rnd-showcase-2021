# A Multi Perspective Access Control in a Smart Home

![](https://i.imgur.com/2rvfQoy.png)

Modern smart homes consist of multiple users controlling multi devices. The device must be properly utilised and shared by different age groups, insiders and outsiders. Current devices don't support proper sharing and allocation of privileges among users. In this work, we design an access control system that allows privileges from multiple perspectives like time, location, age group and task being performed in the smart home. Thus, making the smart homes intelligent enough to make the appropriate decisions for privilege management.
