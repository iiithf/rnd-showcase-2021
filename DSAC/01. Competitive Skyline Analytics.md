# Competitive Skyline Analytics

The skyline of a dataset consists of the best points given a preference over the attributes of the datasets. While these skyline point are incomparable, some skyline points are more competitive than others. We quantify the competitiveness between any two skyline points and also provide a measure for the competitive density around a given point. Naturally, a region of high competitive density would correspond to a competitive market segment.
