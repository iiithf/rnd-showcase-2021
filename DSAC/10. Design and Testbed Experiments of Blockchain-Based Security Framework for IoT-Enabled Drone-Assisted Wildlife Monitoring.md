# Design and Testbed Experiments of Blockchain-Based Security Framework for IoT-Enabled Drone-Assisted Wildlife Monitoring

Drones is used for wildlife monitoring as these are remote-controlled devices having the capability for collecting wildlife information from difficult-to-access places with minimum disturbance. Unconditional growing human activities make an environmental situation that creates a threat to wildlife. The purpose of utilizing a drone in a wildlife environment is not only for monitoring the population of wild animals, wildlife species, quantity, habits, and quality of life, but can also be used for a routine survey that reveals the actual state of biodiversity. In addition, use of drones in such an environment should guarantee a quick response for any strange environmental activity that can affect the wild animal population and take a precaution before any permanent damage has been made.
