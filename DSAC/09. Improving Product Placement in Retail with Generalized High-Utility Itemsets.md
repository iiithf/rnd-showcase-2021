# Improving Product Placement in Retail with Generalized High-Utility Itemsets

![](https://i.imgur.com/x0NZCdV.png)

The knowledge of generalized high-utility itemsets extracted from user purchase transactional database in conjunction with a product taxonomy can provide new insights about customer purchase behaviour. This work proposes the generalized utility itemset (GUI) index for retrieving generalized high-utility (revenue) itemsets. We also present a framework, which leverages the GUI index towards retail product placement to improve revenue.
