# Decoding Reed Muller Codes

Reed-Muller Codes are among the oldest known error-correcting codes. The Reed-Muller code with parameters q, m, r, denoted RM(q, m, r), is the set of evaluations of all m-variate polynomials in Fq[X1, ..., Xm] of total degree at most r and individual degree at most q ? 1 over all points in Fq. There are various algorithms for the decoding of Reed-Muller codes. We are going to present the Recursive Decoding of Reed-Muller codes using techniques such as projection and puncturing and Efficient ML syndrome decoding of RM(m-3,m) codes by exploiting the code symmetry to reduce the size of the syndrome table. The projection-based decoding algorithm involves projecting the code on its cosets and recursively decoding the projected codes whereas the puncturing-based algorithm uses the concept of the automorphism group of the code and involves puncturing of the code to lower order codes and recursively decoding the punctured codes. The Efficient ML syndrome decoding of RM(m-3, m) codes uses the idea of Affine transformations (based on automorphism group) to reduce the size of the syndrome table.
