# Millimeter wave downlink system

![](https://i.imgur.com/96CUyx3.png)

We present a low-complexity beamformer design for millimeter-wave communication systems. A fully analog architecture with a single radio frequency (RF) chain is employed for multi-user transmission. This is achieved using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) as the radio access technique that further leads to improved spectral efficiency and reduction in the hardware complexity. The proposed design is also suitable for the scenario, where perfect channel state information is not available thus making the design of wider applicability.
