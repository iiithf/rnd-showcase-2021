# Demo - AirIoT - Air Pollution Monitoring Network using Low-Cost Sensors

![]()

IIITH is doing a DST/PRIF research project on IoT-enabled smart cities: pollution, health, and Governance. In the first phase, we have deployed 11 nodes inside the IIITH campus, which are running for the last year. You can see the dashboard here: https://spcrc.iiit.ac.in/air In the next phase, we are in the process of deploying 40 nodes in the Gachibowli region. There are three main objectives of this research project: 1) Set-up an internet of things (IoT) network for monitoring air pollution in urban conditions in Indian cities. 2) To correlate the pollution measurements to quality of health parameters such as respiratory, cardiovascular and psycho-physiological effects on the health of the people in general and specifically on children and public service personnel. 3) To develop a web-based spatial data platform for dynamic geo-visualization of the data from the IoT network to provide citizen advisory and governance.
