# Buffer assistant amplify and forward relay using MM technique

![](https://i.imgur.com/rNjLrfB.png)

Unmanned Aerial vehicles can be used as a relay between source and destination nodes where terrestrial communication is not feasible. In our case, UAV acts as a buffer assistant amplify and forward relay using MM algorithm to provide better communication links. In the technique, we maximized the SNR(signal to noise ratio) by keeping constraints on the power variables,UAV trajectory variables, along with the conditions on the time-slot pairing of the received and transferred signal at the UAV. The results obtained from the various techniques are examined and plotted to understand the effectiveness of the techniques.
