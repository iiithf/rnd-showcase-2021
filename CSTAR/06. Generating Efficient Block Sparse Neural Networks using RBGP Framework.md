# Generating Efficient Block Sparse Neural Networks using RBGP Framework

![](https://i.imgur.com/tiMUNHQ.png)

 We use RBGP( Ramanujan Bipartite Graph Product) framework for generating structured multi level block sparse neural networks by using the theory of Graph products. We also propose to use products of Ramanujan graphs which gives the best connectivity for a given level of sparsity and use these graph structures in model compression. We also test these on various computer vision tasks like Imagenet classification and Semantic Segmentation.
