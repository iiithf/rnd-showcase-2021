Internet of Things (IoT) is the latest era of connecting smart devices to exchange data with other objects. However, it has several security challenges such as privacy, integrity, confidentiality, authenticity and active & passive attacks. The access control mechanism plays a very crucial role as IoT devices require to send/receive data securely to their nearby gateway node and its associated edge server(s). In blockchain, once the blocks are added it can not be further modified, updated or deleted. It is required to design a blockchain-enabled access control scheme for edge computing based generic IoT environment.
