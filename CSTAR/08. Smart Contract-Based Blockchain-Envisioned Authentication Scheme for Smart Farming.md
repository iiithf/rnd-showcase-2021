# Smart Contract-Based Blockchain-Envisioned Authentication Scheme for Smart Farming

A blockchain-based smart farming technology provides the agricultural data to the farmers and other users associated with smart farming on a single integrated platform. Moreover, persistence and auditability of stored data in blocks into the blockchain provide the confidence of using the correct data when needed later and adds transparency, anonymity and traceability at the same time. To fulfill such a goal, in this paper, we design a new smart contract-based blockchain-envisioned authenticated key agreement mechanism in a smart farming environment. The device-to-device (D2D) authentication phase and device-to-gateway (D2G) authentication phase support mutual authentication and key agreement between two Internet of Things (IoT) enabled devices and between an IoT device and the gateway node in the network, respectively. The blocks are created by the edge servers on the authenticated data of IoT devices received from the gateway nodes and then sent to the cloud server. The smart contract-based consensus mechanism allows verification and addition of the formed blocks by a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud servers network. The security of the proposed scheme is done through formal and informal security analysis, and also using the formal security verification tool. A detailed comparative study reveals that the proposed scheme offers superior security and more functionality features as compared to existing competing authentication protocols. Finally, the blockchain based simulation has been conducted to measure computational time for a varied number of mined blocks and also a varied number of transactions per block.
