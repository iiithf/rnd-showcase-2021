# Parallel algorithms for multi-source BFS and its applications

![](https://i.imgur.com/INB8Gwp.png)

Multi-source BFS is an interesting problem because of its inherent use in solving various problems such as algorithms to find betweenness centrality, diameter computation, shortest path calculations. Our Multi-BFS algorithm provides a space-saving and faster solution to multi-source BFSs on GPU. We use hybrid-CSR representation for graph storage and linear algebra method to perform BFS from multiple sources.
