# Blockchain-based batch authentication protocol for Internet of Vehicles

![](https://i.imgur.com/k96vEzq.png)

The vehicles in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) can be used to opportunistically gather and distribute the data in a smart city environment. However, at the same time due to open channel, various security threats arise due to insecure communication happening among various entities in an IoV-based smart city deployment. To address this issue, we aim to design a novel blockchain-enabled batch authentication scheme in Artificial Intelligence (AI)- envisioned IoV-based smart city deployment. Incorporation of AI/Machine Learning (ML) in blockchaining produces a secure, efficient and intelligent blockchain based system. The data stored in the blocks in the blockchain are authentic and genuine, which makes the AI/ML algorithms to work at their exceptions in order produce correct predictions on the blockchain data. The proposed scheme is highly robust against various well known security attacks.
