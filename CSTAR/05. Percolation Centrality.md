# Percolation Centrality

![](https://i.imgur.com/htO0R64.png)

We propose a modification of Brandes algorithm for computing the source-destination variant of Percolation Centrality in O(|V||E|) time. We also present a scheme to parallelize the algorithm using a graph decomposition into biconnected components.
