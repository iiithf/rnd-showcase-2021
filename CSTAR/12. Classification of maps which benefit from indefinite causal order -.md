# Classification of maps which benefit from indefinite causal order -

Using indefinite causal order, we apply two operations in a superposition, with a control qubit, which increases the fidelity of some set of operation. We try to get a generalizedregion of operations where the indefinite causal order provides an advantage over applying the maps in a normal order.
