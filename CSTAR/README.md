# Center for Security, Theory and Algorithms

The goal of the center is to do research in information security, theory and algorithms. Center for Security, Theory and Algorithms (CSTAR) is engaged in devising efficient algorithms for various problems, modeling and abstractization of various concepts, and security guarantees of the computation when operating in an adverse environment. Some of the problems lie at the intersection of multiple domains and require a combination of theoretical rigor and practical acceptability. The center is working on several cutting edge problems in several areas. Some of these areas are: - Distributed and multi-core algorithms, system and network security, data structures, secure multiparty computation, and the like. - Distributed algorithms for symmetry breaking via randomization, and a formal study of fault-tolerance of distributed computing - Secure solutions for problems arising in the field of system security and network security. - Secure algorithms for computer vision based problems such as video surveillance, security of robotic systems. - Efficient implementations of parallel algorithms on present generation architectures such as the GPU, the IBM Cell, and other multi-core architectures.
