# Revocation and Reconstruction of Shared Quantum Secret

![](https://i.imgur.com/SBpAmMv.png)

In Quantum secret sharing we can share both quantum and classical secrets with a quantum resource. In this article we study the problem of revocation of quantum secret shared by the dealer with two shareholders in a three party scenario. In the existing secret sharing protocols there are no means by which the dealer can retract back the secret once he/she finds all the share holders to be dishonest. Our protocol makes a significant advancement in solving this problem by designing strategy in bringing back the secret in the worst possible situation when all the shareholders are dishonest. In our proposed strategy the dealer also possesses a quantum share of the secret which empowers the dealer to bring back the secret even after sharing is done. However the protocol along with the revocation process also ensures the normal reconstruction at the share holder s location when they are honest. This advantage comes with the expense of extra one qubit on dealer s side and consequently we require a four qubit to start with for 1-dealer and 2-share holder s scenario. Here in this article we not only give the description of our protocol but also give an example with the help of a four qubit entangled state. In short this gives us a significant advantage in terms of the security of the secret.
