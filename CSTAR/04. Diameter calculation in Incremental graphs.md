# Diameter calculation in Incremental graphs

![](https://i.imgur.com/gcA69qE.png)

Incremental graphs are the graphs whose edges can be added or deleted with time.Static graphs are the graphs whose set of edges and nodes remains constant with time.There exists an efficient algorithm called IFUB algorithm for static graphs whose worst time complexity is O(mn) but this algorithm in practice executes in O(m) time when applied to real-world networks.But when this IFUB algorithm is applied to incremental graphs,the algorithm requires a lot of recomputation.So,we are storing some of the information while running the algorithm so that recomputation will be reduced while performing a new run of the algorithm.

### Research Area

Graph algorithms.


### Type of Work

Algorithm.


### Current State of work

Technology designed but not implemented.


### Potential Applications

Real world networks are incremental graphs and the diameter computation helps us to know the development of network with time.Ex:-Facebook can be visualized as a graph where every node is a person and edge between two persons indicate whether they are friends and this graph is an incremental graph as we can unfriend a person in facebook due to which the edge between those two persons will be deleted.
