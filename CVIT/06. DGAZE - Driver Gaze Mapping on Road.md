# DGAZE - Driver Gaze Mapping on Road

![](https://i.imgur.com/4xF4rrF.png)

Our paper published in IROS 2020 Introduces DGAZE - a new driver gaze mapping dataset. The dataset consists of roadview and driver view image pairs. Pointwise and objectwise annotations are provided. Unlike other driver gaze datasets which require eye trackers during deployment, models trained by our dataset only requires a dashboard-mounted camera. We also present I-DGAZE, a two-branch late-fusion network to predict driver eye gaze on road. Our architecture achives state-of-the-art results on the DGAZE dataset.
