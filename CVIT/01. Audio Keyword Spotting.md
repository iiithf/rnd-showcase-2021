# Audio Keyword Spotting

![](https://i.imgur.com/pgzVZu8.png)

We use traditional Automatic Speech Recognition Framework to transcribe audio, but when we want to detect the presence of a specific set of words in the audio, we don't have to transcribe the entire audio. Here we convert the audio into a fixed representation space, and we convert the audio keyword also into that fixed representation space and use cosine similarity to compare the similarity between the audio and keyword set in that representation space using sliding window approach. We try to reduce the number of parameters required to do it while retaining the performance. The keyword set is open, hence the representation is universal for all acoustic word in a specific language.
