# The Interplay of Speech and Lip Movements

![](https://i.imgur.com/FClAoHL.png)

The interplay of speech and lip movements has received considerable attention in recent years. The strong connection between these two modalities allows us to understand and predict one from the other. In this demo video, we extensively explore this close relationship through several of our stateof-the-art efforts. We will also look at the multitude of applications that can be spawned from each of these works. Our works have been published in ACM Multimedia 2019 and 2020 (selected for Oral Presentation), CVPR 2020 and WACV 2021. Please contact us for more details about the works.
