Our paper published in, DAS 2020 focues on improving word recognition and retrieval. Systems only relying on text recogniser s output are not robust enough for this task as they fail to generate accurate text. In this work we investigate different methods for improving word recognition and retrieval on scanned pages using text recogniser s noisy text and deep embeddings. We propose methods which include fusing noisy text recogniser s output and deep embeddings of the word images for improved word recognition and retrieval. With the aid of text recogniser s multiple hypotheses, we improve the word recognition accuracy by 1.4% on highly noisy data. To improve word retrieval, we exploit the fact that deep embeddings have high recall while text recogniser has high precision. Using our technique, we show that we are able to improve the mAP by 11.13% over text recogniser s base results. We use techniques like average and max fusion for improving the ranked results.
