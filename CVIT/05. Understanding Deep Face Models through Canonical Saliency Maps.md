# Understanding Deep Face Models through Canonical Saliency Maps

![](https://i.imgur.com/tLdTWKV.png)

We present Canonical Saliency Maps, a new simple, yet effective, method for visualizing relevant facial areas for classification decisions. These maps are high-resolution and provide actionable insights into the working of deep models. They are also further processed to detect problems in deep face models and diagnose them. Canonical Image Saliency (CIS) maps highlight facial features responsible for the decision made by the deep face model on a given image. Canonical Model Saliency (CMS) maps provide an understanding of what a model focuses on in a given task, and can also be used to detect biases inherent in the model. Our visualization algorithms can be used on any deep face model regardless of the architecture.
