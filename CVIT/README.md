# Center for Visual Information Technology

Center for Visual Information Technology (CVIT) focuses on basic and advanced research in image processing, computer vision, computer graphics and machine learning. This center deals with the generation, processing, and understanding of primarily visual data as well as with the techniques and tools required doing so efficiently. The activity of this center overlaps the traditional areas of Computer Vision, Image Processing, Computer Graphics, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. CVIT works on both theoretical as well as practical aspects of visual information processing. Center aims to keep the right balance between the cutting edge academic research and impactful applied research.
