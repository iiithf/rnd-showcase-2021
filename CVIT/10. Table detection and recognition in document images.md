# Table detection and recognition in document images

![](https://i.imgur.com/WhWtrUJ.png)

Our work, comprises of two papers published in ECCV'20 and ICPR'20, present a novel end-to-end trainable deep network, (CDeC-Net) for detecting tables in the documents with high accuracy. We also present TabStruct-Net that combines cell detection and interaction modules to localize the cells and predict their row and column. The methods achieve state of the art accuracies on publically available datasets.
