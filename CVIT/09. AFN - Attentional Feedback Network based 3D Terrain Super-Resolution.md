# AFN - Attentional Feedback Network based 3D Terrain Super-Resolution

![](https://i.imgur.com/rgb6MGt.png)

Terrain, representing features of an earth surface, plays a crucial role in many applications such as simulations, route planning, analysis of surface dynamics, computer graphics-based games, entertainment, films, to name a few. With recent advancements in digital technology, these applications demand the presence of high resolution details in the terrain. In this work, we propose a novel fully convolutional neural network based super-resolution architecture to increase the resolution of low-resolution Digital Elevation Model (LRDEM) with the help of information extracted from the corresponding aerial image as a complementary modality. We perform the super-resolution of LRDEM using an attention based feedback mechanism named Attentional Feedback Network (AFN), which selectively fuses the information from LRDEM and aerial image to enhance and infuse the high-frequency features and to produce the terrain realistically .
