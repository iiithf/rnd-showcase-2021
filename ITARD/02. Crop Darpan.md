Normally, it is difficult for a typical farmer to identify the field problem. A typical farmer must depend on an agricultural expert to identify the crop problem. The Crop Darpan tool is built to enable the typical farmer to identify the crop problem. It considers that farmer possesses a smart phone (or a notebook/laptop) with an internet connection and visits the field. The Crop Darpan tool guides the farmer to identify the field problem. After identifying the field problem, the farmer can take corrective steps by understanding the diagnostic advice provided by the system or contact the agricultural expert.
