To bridge the information gap between the agricultural expert and the farmer, International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad has built the eSagu (**Sagu** means cultivation in Telugu language) system, which is an IT-based personalized agricultural extension system to improve agricultural productivity by disseminating expert agricultural advice to the farmers, both in a timely and personalized manner. In e-Sagu, the agricultural experts generate the expert advice based on the information about the crop the situation received in the form of both text and digital photographs. In village level eSagu system, a group of villages are formed into a cluster. A few sample farms were selected in each cluster that covers all major and minor crops in that cluster. Once every 10 days crop photographs are collected from these sample frames and the expert agricultural advice is disseminated.
