Deep learning methods such as graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) along with graph diffusion have been shown to handle complex structures and preserve global information. We propose two methods: (i) multiple heat kernel graph convolutional neural networks (MHK-GCN) (which uses average FC matrices) and (ii) temporal multiple heat kernel graph convolutional neural networks (tMHK-GCN) (which uses time-varying FC matrices obtained using sliding window techniques over fMRI time series), leveraging heat kernel diffusion to determine graph connectivity structure at multiple scales. We argue that the proposed methods overcome the scalability and computational inefficiency issues but still are able to successfully learn the SC-FC mapping.
