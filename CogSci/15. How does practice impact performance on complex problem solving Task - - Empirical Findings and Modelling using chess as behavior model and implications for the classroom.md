# How does practice impact performance on complex problem solving Task - - Empirical Findings and Modelling using chess as behavior model and implications for the classroom

Prior research on expertise had demonstrated the role of Knowledge and search during complex problem solving Task. However, most of the evidence has been indirect ,based on theoretical assumptions and in lab conditions. Here we provide quantitative and ecologically valid estimates based on one of the largest opensource chess database. We analyzed 36 Million games by 9 Million Players from 2018 to 2020(longitudinal study) by individuals ranging from amateurs to masters. 1)The amount of monochrestic (single-use/implicit) and rote knowledge (explicit) held by chess players of varying skill levels. 2)The influence of time pressure and prior-result on performance. 3)Relation between Practice and performance (and moderating factors) 4)Identify potential behavioral signs for addiction. These results can inform the design of personalized study plans for students.
