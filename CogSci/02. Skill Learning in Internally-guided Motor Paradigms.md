# Skill Learning in Internally-guided Motor Paradigms

![](https://i.imgur.com/1yBgaa2.png)

We describe our work on motor skill learning in internally-guided sequencing paradigms. Using Grid-Sailing Task as our canonical paradigm, we show role of multiple learning components (motor and cognitive) in sequencing behavior. We further probe role of chunking in practice=driven performance improvements in such paradigms.
