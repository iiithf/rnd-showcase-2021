# Kinship Recognition - Comparing Eye-Tracking Results with Model Estimates

We present results from a parent-child kinship study (12 parents/children sets) through a novel approach of correlating eye-tracking data of 46 participants reflecting human perception-attention process with current face matching and recognition models. We use interpretable machine learning techniques to address black-box trust perceptions. The eye-tracking results show bias like parent-gender dependencies, familiarity, and global vs local facial feature preferences. These attributes were considered in evaluating the performance and robustness of current algorithmic models.
