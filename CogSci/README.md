# Cognitive Science

Cognitive Science (CogSci) is an interdisciplinary approach to study the brain, the mind and behaviour by embracing artificial intelligence, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, and anthropology. We offer a PhD program in Cognitive Science. Students in the B.Tech, M.Tech, MS and PhD programs in CSE, ECE, CLD, or CND can also do a thesis in Cognitive Science. We have state-of-the-art infrastructural facilities like Tobii Eye Tracker, Emotiv EEG, physiology monitoring devices from BioNomadix and Thought Technology.
