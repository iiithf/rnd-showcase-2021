# Characterisation of development of the ageing brain

![](https://i.imgur.com/CyLnmJ5.png)

We are looking to haracterize the development of the ageing brain using graph network measures. Especially, we probe into how the modularity of the network changes across lifespan. In specific, we speculate that modules that develop early will age the last and those that mature later will age faster.
