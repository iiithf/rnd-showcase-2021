# Implications of Stress on Abstract Problem Solving Ability

Because of the covid-19 pandemic, most people are under lockdown and in Priyanka Srivastava severe stress about their livelihoods. In this stressful condition, there are students who write JEE and other competitive exams for their admissions. Many of these exams test students based on their abstract problem-solving capabilities. Here, we aim to look at how psychological stress can affect a person s abstract problem solving ability. Past research has shown how stress can affect one s memory and other aspects of cognition, however not sufficient research has been done in this aspect of problem-solving. In this experiment, 62 participants were asked to solve six advanced progressive matrices, and then subjected to either a stress or a non-stress intervention (using Montreal Imaging Stress Task), and then asked to solve six more advanced progressive matrices. The results show a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the score of the participant across the pre-test and the post-test, and a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in the time taken across the two tests, implying a complex relationship between stress and problem solving.
