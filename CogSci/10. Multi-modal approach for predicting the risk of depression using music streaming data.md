# Multi-modal approach for predicting the risk of depression using music streaming data

![](https://i.imgur.com/lO9cUm4.png)

This research aims to investigate the association between the risk of depression and music preferences in terms of genres and emotions through different modalities, including acoustic features, social and semantic tags associated with musical content, lyrical features, and user streaming statistics, using online music listening history from Last.fm. These features are being looked at in a static, overall fashion in addition to investigating dynamic patterns since underlying emotional states change over time and may be reflected in the kind of music consumed, and further, these features can be used to predict the risk of depression using machine learning models. We also intend to examine individual differences in terms of gender and personality traits as they might be indicative of underlying risk for depression. Collectively, the findings can aid the early detection and diagnosis of depression, and could possibly be used to modulate the music recommendations provided to individuals at risk, to help alleviate their symptoms.
