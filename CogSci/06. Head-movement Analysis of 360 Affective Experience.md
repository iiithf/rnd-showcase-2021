![](https://i.imgur.com/CROf37W.png)

The research focuses on understanding emotions, that is the affective experience using virtual reality head-movement technology. The study observes a significant positive correlation between head-movement and valence, where valence is a dimension of affect covering a spectrum from unpleasant to pleasant emotions. The research aims at forming objective assessment methods to detect proneness to mood disorders like depression by analyzing the similarities and differences between the head-movement data across emotional states. This will not only aid the healthcare community with early intervention but also will help delaying the very first episode of depression.
