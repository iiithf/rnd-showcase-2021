# Mining Musicality with Multimodal Fusion

![](https://i.imgur.com/6S5dr2E.png)

The aim of this project is to discover the neural bases of musical aptitude using a multi-modal fusion technique. We plan on doing this by using results obtained by examining the structural and functional aspects of the brain and combining it with behavioral measures, using said multi-modal connectomics and fusion techniques
