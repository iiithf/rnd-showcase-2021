# DeepMPCVS - Deep Model Predictive Control For Visual Servoing

![](https://i.imgur.com/wwZhwN4.png)

A novel unsupervised method that formulates the problem of 6DoF visual servoing as an MPC optimisation and solves it using a recurrent neural network which optimises over a novel optical flow-based loss function.
