# Earthquake Engineering Research Centre

Earthquake Engineering Research Centre (EERC) was established to contribute towards construction of safe building infrastructure to address the large and rapidly growing urban seismic risk in India and providing solutions to the geotechnical structures. Pre-disaster planning i.e., mitigation and preparedness will have a good impact on minimizing the post-disaster response i.e., emergency, rescue and rehabilitation. GeoTechnical Engineering Lab which is part of EERC conducts research aimed at providing solutions to the geotechnical structures like foundations, retaining walls, tunnels etc.
