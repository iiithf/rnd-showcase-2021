# ASD Classification using Static and Dynamic Functional Connectivity

![](https://i.imgur.com/Lz1dmQE.png)

Autism spectrum disorder, is a developmental disorder characterized by persistent problems in social communication and interaction, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities. The current psychiatric diagnostic process is based purely on the behavioral observation of symptomology (DSM-5/ICD-10) and may be prone to misdiagnosis. For more quantitative diagnosis, we need advanced and scalable machine learning infrastructure that will allow us to identify reliable biomarkers of mental health disorders. Research has revealed that brain connectivity analysis provides crucial insights to pinpoint the differences between autistic and typically developing (TD) children during development. Since functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can measure brain activity, it provides data for the study of brain dysfunction disorders and has been widely used in ASD identification. In our approach we are exploring different static and dynamic functional connectivity properties which can be extracted using resting state fmri scans and can well differentiate these autistic children from healthy children accurately.
