Estimating brain age and establishing functional biomarkers that are prescient of cognitive decline resulting from ageing and different neurological diseases are still open research problems. Resting-state fMRI enables us to investigate functional brain networks and can potentially help us understand the processes of development as well as ageing in terms of how functional connectivity (FC) matures during the early years and declines during the late years. We propose models for estimation of the chronological age of a healthy person from the resting state brain activation (rsfMRI). In this work, we utilized a dataset (N = 638, age-range 20-87) of rsfMRI images from the Cam-CAN repository of a healthy population. We train both machine learning and deep learning models for brain age assessment. We extracted features from the static functional connectivity (sFC) for predicting the subject's age and classifying them into different age groups (young, middle, middle-old and old ages). We also analysed how different functional regions contribute differently across ages by applying attention-based networks and activation maps.
