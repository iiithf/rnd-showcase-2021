# Deep Learning in Histopathology Whole Slide Images -

![](https://i.imgur.com/mDvKT7s.png)

Deep learning-based techniques have shown to be beneficial for automating diagnosis on Histopathology medical images. In this project, we perform Classification of Brain Tumor from Whole Slide Histopathology images into its subtypes namely Astrocytoma, Oligodendroglioma. To work with Whole Slide Images is challenging due to its huge resolution (1,00,000 x 80,000). Training a CNN on Whole Slide Images is computationally impossible due to its huge size. To capture the tissue features we perform a patch-based method where we divide the image into patches of small size and predict the Image label on the patch based results. To model the fact that not all patches will be discriminative i.e; not all patches extracted from a Whole Slide Image represent the tumour label. We propose an MIL bases approach to elimate the non discriminative patches. The final selected patches are used to train a CNN classifier and predict the Whole Slide Image label based on average pooling method.
