# Explainable Arrythmia Detection using Deep Learning

![](https://i.imgur.com/oToXuL4.png)

Explainable Arthymia detection deals with the problem of interpretability of arrthymia detection which was tackled currently using classical ml approaches like svm now with the help of deep learning better explainability can be given so a doctor form a non technical background can get aid in decision making in real time.
