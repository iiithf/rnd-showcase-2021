Coronavirus, an RNA virus is capable of causing Respiratory Tract Infections in humans and birds. The ability of Coronavirus to transmit has introduced a challenge to predict the host of coronavirus which is essential to control the future pandemics. The study mainly focuses on genome sequences of the Coronaviridae family for their host prediction.Host prediction with ML algorithms like SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest gave high average accuracies, F1 scores, sensitivities and specificities. The study indicate that machine learning algorithms alone can be used to predict hosts of coronavirus.
