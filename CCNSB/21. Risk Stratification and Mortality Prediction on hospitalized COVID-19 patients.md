The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, is an acute respiratorydisease that has been classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The sudden spikein the number of infections and high mortality rates have put immense pressure on the public healthcaresystems. Hence, it is crucial to identify the key factors for mortality prediction to optimize patient treatmentstrategy. Different routine blood test results are widely available compared to other forms of data like X-rays,CT-scans and ultrasounds for mortality prediction. This study proposes machine learning (ML) methods based on blood tests data to predict COVID-19 Severity/Mortality which can be used for better utilisation of medical resources.
