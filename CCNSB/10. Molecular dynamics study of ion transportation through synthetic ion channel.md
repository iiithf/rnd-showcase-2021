# Molecular dynamics study of ion transportation through synthetic ion channel

The natural ion channels are pore forming transmembrane proteins with hydrophilic core & hydrophobic covering. Defects in these channel leads to many human diseases, channelopathies, examples, epilepsies, cardiac dysfunction, cystic fibrosis etc. In such cases, synthetic ion channels are potential candidates for transporting ions with more robustness for standing in extreme environmental shocks. Molecular level insights of the role of ion channels and their interactions with ions are not readily amenable to experimental techniques. In order to investigate the such phenomena at atomic level Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed. Anion selective channels have studied less compareed to cation channels. In this work anion selective, unimolecular, cyclodextrin base, channel have been used to look over the transportation.
