# Hunting for scalar leptoquarks with boosted tops and light leptons

![](https://i.imgur.com/4KDRwym.png)

The LHC search strategy for leptoquarks (LQ) that couple dominately to a top quark are different for the ones that couple mostly to light quarks. By combining the pair and single production process, we can see an enhancement in the discovery reach of the LHC for LQs.
