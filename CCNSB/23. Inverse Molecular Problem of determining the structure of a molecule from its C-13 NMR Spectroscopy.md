# Inverse Molecular Problem of determining the structure of a molecule from its C-13 NMR Spectroscopy

![](https://i.imgur.com/0TDQvS1.png)

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is an important tool in identifying molecules in a sample. Despite having a large database of previously observed NMR Spectra, we have only discovered a tiny fraction of the actual chemical space. With advent of machine learning and deep learning methods, this calls for a way to be capable of finding the nature and structure of sample from its NMR Spectra.
