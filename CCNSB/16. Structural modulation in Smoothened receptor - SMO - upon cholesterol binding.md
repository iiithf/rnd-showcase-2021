# Structural modulation in Smoothened receptor - SMO - upon cholesterol binding

The Smoothened receptor (SMO, a 7 pass transmembrane domain, Class F GPCR family protein) plays a crucial role in the Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway, involved in embryonic development, and is implicated in various types of cancer throughout the animal kingdom. SMO is inhibited by Patched (Ptc1; a 12 pass transmembrane domain protein) via small molecules by an unknown mechanism. The structures of SMO typically show bound cholesterol molecules in the extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the receptor. Here, we carry out coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the SMO receptor in POPC and in ciliary membrane models, respectively, to analyse its structure, interaction, and dynamics involving membrane cholesterol and other molecules in the ciliary membrane models. We are able to identify the interaction of membrane cholesterols with preferential sites in both TMD and CRD, respectively. We also show that, in the presence of cholesterol molecules in the membrane, there is a build up in the concentration of cholesterol molecules near the cholesterol-binding motif of SMO TMD, which helps to maintain the volume of the TM bundle. In addition, our analysis of the correlated motion of SMO domains shows a significant change in the CRD. Further detailed analysis of the dynamics of the TMD, triggered by interactions involving the extracellular domain (ECD) and extracellular loops ( ECLs), reveals a significant movement of TM6 and smaller movements of TM5 and TM7, linked with the helix H8, thus shaping the conformational disposition of the intracellular domain (ICD).
