# Center for Computational Natural Sciences and Bioinformatics

Center for Computational Natural Sciences and Bioinformatics (CCNSB) is a research center in IIIT Hyderabad that is involved in teaching and research in the areas of computational chemistry, computational and systems biology, bioinformatics, bio-molecular simulations, nanosciences, statistical mechanics and complex systems. Ever increasing computational power and recent advances in computer science, in fields of distributed computing, networking and database management, have inspired the center to explore the application of these newer technologies and methods to understand the functioning of complex physical, chemical and biological systems.
