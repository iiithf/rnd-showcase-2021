# Modeling the liver circadian clock control by nutrients

![](https://i.imgur.com/vIWMAcx.png)

Experiments in recent years on mammalian circadian clocks have shown that external factors such as diet, nutrients and even blood gas concentrations have effects of circadian period, amplitude and phase. mTOR is of importance in various cellular processes such as cell survival, growth, autophagy and protein synthesis. AMPK has a central role in metabolism and cellular energy homeostasis. We studied the effect of diet (AMPK Activity) and Nutrients (MTOR Activity) on the circadian clock. We also simulated the effect of the dual control of mTOR and AMPK on the clock.
