# Dynamic reorganization of transcriptome during liver regeneration

![](https://i.imgur.com/JCRqUUm.png)

Perturbations that interfere with liver functions have serious repercussions leading to several metabolic disorders like hepaticsteatosis, NAFLD(Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), NASH(Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), HCC(hepatocellular carcinoma). Although liver transplantation and partial liver resection have been suggested as possible treatment options to ght such diseases to some extent, they are prone to recurrence after a few years. Therefore a closer insight into underlying molecular mechanisms by harnessing the power of multi-omics technology is the need of the hour. In this direction we attempt to explore recent advancements in this area along with various mathematical tools that can be utilized to gain systems-level understanding of pathophysiology of metabolic disorders.
