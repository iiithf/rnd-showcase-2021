# Qubit Routing Strategies Using Machine Learning

To make an arbitrary quantum circuit executable on a given target architecture, a quantum compiler has to insert SWAP gates so that gates in the original circuit only ever occur between qubits located at adjacent nodes, a process known as Qubit Routing1. The process produce a new circuit, possibly with a greater depth, that implements the same unitary function as the original circuit while respecting the topological constraints
