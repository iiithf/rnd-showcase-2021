# Classification using quantum neural networks

![](https://i.imgur.com/Dfskr1B.png)

The probabilistic nature of qubits and the entanglement between them gives quantum computing an edge over classical computing. Quantum mechanics concepts can be applied to the field of machine learning as well. Quantum machine learning can be used to perform classification problems. The current NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era demands for quantum algorithms to use less qubits and be robust against errors, making variational classifiers ideal for tackling binary classification tasks in NISQ systems and this can be extended to multiclass classification.
