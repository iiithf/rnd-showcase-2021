# Predicting Evaporation events using Deep Learning

![](https://i.imgur.com/SRBV26t.png)

Evaporation on the nanoscale involves transfer of energy in steps from one molecule to the next through HB interactions and intermolecular repulsions. Characterizing it as predominantly an interfacial phenomenon on the time scale, we use several interfacial properties along with the individual properties of the molecule to identify the local area of evaporation.
