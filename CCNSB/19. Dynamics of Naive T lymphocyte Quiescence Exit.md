# Dynamics of Naive T lymphocyte Quiescence Exit

![](https://i.imgur.com/erXhBGz.png)

Naive T lymphocytes are cells of the adaptive immune system that remain in a non-dividing or quiescent state. Antigen exposure triggers their quiescence exit and cell cycle entry. Understanding the dynamics of quiescence exit can aid the therapy of autoimmune and immunodeficiency disorders.
